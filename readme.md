# Code for the paper Variational integrators for a new Lagrangian approach to optimal control affine systems with a quadratic Lagrange term

This code can be used to generate the low-thrust orbitral transfer optimal control problem treated as an example in the paper 'Variational integrators for a new Lagrangian approach to optimal control affine systems with a quadratic Lagrange term' by Konopik et al, using variational integrators derved from a new Lagrangian approach to solving optimal control problems.

It consists of two parts:
1. A program that generates a dataset of the optimal control problem for a given set of parameters
2. The script that generates the figures of the paper once all data sets are generated
